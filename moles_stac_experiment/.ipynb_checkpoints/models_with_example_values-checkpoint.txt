cedamoles_app.project
	title: ECMWF Trajectories project
	abstract: These data are produced at the ECMWF as part of a special project run by Prof. Brian Hoskins and Dr. Paul Berrisford of Reading University. The project is part of the Joint Diagnostics Project (JDP) between Reading University, The UK Meteorological Office and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts). The aim of the project is to provide a database of routine back trajectories.

	title: ECMWF trajectories model data for acsoe
	abstract: Datasets of 5 day back trajectories have been computed on a routine basis using analyses from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). The three components of the wind and surface pressure over three launch grids covering the UK, the mid-Atlantic storm track region and the eastern USA, plus back trajectories from field campaign instrument sites were used to output datasets consisting of latitude, longitude and pressure of the trajectory every 30 minutes.

This dataset contains ECMWF trajectories model data for acsoe.

	title: Met Office: Vaisala CL31 Ceilometer
	abstract: The Met Office own a number of Vaisala CL31 ceilometers used for detecting cloud base heights and also for obtaining backscatter profiles to aid ash cloud detection.  The CL31 employs a pulsed diode laser LIDAR (light detection and ranging) technology, which enables it to detect three cloud layers simultaneously.

Fast measurement helps to detect thin cloud patches below a solid cloud base. The CL31 provides a full backscatter profile for data visualization and research purpose. The CL31 beam can be directed either vertically or tilted. The tilting option together with the novel optics design provides enhanced performance during precipitation by improving the protection given by the shield. In the measurement unit, a tilt angle sensor automatically corrects the measured cloud distance reading to vertical cloud base height.
